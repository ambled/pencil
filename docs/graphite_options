This is a list of the supported graph-level options for pencil, which
correspond to request(image)-level options for graphite. These options are
key-value pairs, and are passed directly to graphite. Here is the list, with
brief descriptions:

vtitle: string (y-axis label)
yMin: number
yMax: number
lineWidth: number (line thickness)
areaMode: [first, all , stacked]
template: alphas (alpha masking)
lineMode: staircase (staircase line)
bgcolor: color string
graphOnly: bool (ax legend, axes, grid)
hideAxes: bool
hideGrid: bool
hideLegend: bool
fgcolor: color string
fontSize: number
fontName: string
fontItalic: bool
fontBold: bool
